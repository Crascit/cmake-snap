# Release Instructions

When an official CMake release is made, run the link:doRelease.sh[doRelease.sh] script locally on a Linux machine.
Pass the release number as the only command line argument.
Release candidates are supported.

```
./doRelease.sh 3.22.0-rc3
```

The script will run two `snapcraft remote-build` jobs.
The first builds the majority of the snaps using the `core20` base.
The second builds the `i386` architecture, which has to use the `core18` base.
Once both builds have been completed, the log files will be collected into a tarball `cmake_<version>_logs.tar.gz` for easy archiving.
All the snaps will be downloaded to the current directory by the `remote-build` jobs.

Once all `remote-build` jobs have been completed, the snaps will be uploaded to the `edge` channel of the relevant track.
The uploads are done in parallel, since they can take a while.
Once all uploads have been completed, the script will finish.

# GitHub Integration

There are problems with the GitHub integration which prevent it from being suitable for release builds at this time:

* It always builds the default branch, regardless of which branch is pushed to trigger a build.
  See https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snap-build-service-picking-default-branch-instead-of-pushed-branch>[this forum post] describing the problem.
* We need to specify a specific source tag for the CMake repo in release builds, which requires modifying the link:snap/snapcraft.yaml[snapcraft.yaml] file.
* We have to modify the base used due to the `i386` architecture not being supported as of `core20`, which also requires modifying the link:snap/snapcraft.yaml[snapcraft.yaml] file.

We also cannot use GitHub actions directly because it doesn't support building for all the architectures we need.
