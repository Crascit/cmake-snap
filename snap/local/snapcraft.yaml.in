summary: "Cross-platform software build system generator"
description: |
  CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed
  to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the
  software compilation process using simple platform and compiler
  independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles
  and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of
  your choice.

  This snap is maintained separately from the CMake project by one
  of the CMake co-maintainers.
